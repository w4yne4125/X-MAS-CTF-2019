### Problem Description

> It seems that Santa may have used some Invisible Ink to write this letter… he is surely playing Hide&Seek

Given a png file, try to get flag.

### Solution 

Based on the problem description, I googled for the Invisible Ink on a image and found a application, after downloading it, there was a algorithm named "Hide&Seek" in it.

Simply get the flag using that application.
