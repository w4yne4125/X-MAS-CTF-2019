### Problem Description

Do you know how Java RMI work?

### Solution

This is an easy problem, just change the `sayHello` function called in `Client.java` to `getSecret`, then run it. The server will reply that the flag is not in the registry `Hello`. Then, change it to `FLAG`, and we can get the flag successfully.
